## Idea

The idea of the project is as an intra-organizational employment-oriented service that operates via mobile apps. The cities that we have used as a test case are Dhanbad and Ranchi, however, it can be oriented towards any other City  or Country as well. The main goal is to brought immediate search response i.e. best or nearest hospital(via google map) which is suitable for patient’s current condition. The app can be very useful in critical situations. This app provides suitable doctor in nearest hospital which is in budget of patient’s family .![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97121860/198891487-7c9b40e7-89b2-4713-a667-9fcc0eb3db36.png)
